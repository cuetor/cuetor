This account is my first project through this platform, hopefully Im doing it right. 
This repository was created following the instructions a was given by my instructor, still a work in progress.
First step I had to download the desktop version of GitHub. Step 2 log in, in hte application. Step 3 cloned the repository. Once you click on clone repository, this will open a new window that shows a list with the GitHub repositories. Then I choose the repository I wanted to clone, and saved to a file a created in my computer.
